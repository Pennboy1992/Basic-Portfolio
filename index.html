        My name is Roman Penn, failed drug dealer, enthusatic web developer aspirant, optimistic future
        millionaire.
        I grew up in Shreveport, LA. I lived a fairly normal childhood and grew up in a very loving home with
        two
        amazing parents. So naturally growing up in a great home meant I was destined to be the next Pablo
        Escobar!
        So after that didn't pan out I decided to work for an organization that could teach me how to do illegal
        stuff and get away with it. So I got a job in the most illegal organization I knew: the government. The
        quickest way to accomplish that for me was through the United States Marine Corps.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Once I got out of the Marine Corps I tried to re-establish my dominance in the market but it
        had been overtaken by Jessie Pinkman and Walter White. However, after further research Walter White had passed
        and Jessie was struggling to get back up. When I reached out he stated he was not interested in a partnership at
        this time and ended the conversation with "if you call me again I'm calling the cops".</p>

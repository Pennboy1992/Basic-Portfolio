                My name is Roman Penn, failed drug dealer, enthusatic web developer aspirant, optimistic future
                millionaire.
                I grew up in Shreveport, LA. I lived a fairly normal childhood and grew up in a very loving home with
                two
                amazing parents. So naturally growing up in a great home meant I was destined to be the next Pablo
                Escobar!
                So after that didn't pan out I decided to work for an organization that could teach me how to do illegal
                stuff and get away with it. So I got a job in the most illegal organization I knew: the government. The
                quickest way to accomplish that for me was through the United States Marine Corps.

        My name is Roman Penn, failed drug dealer, enthusatic web developer aspirant, optomistic future millionaire.  I grew up in Shreveport, LA. I lived a fairly normal childhood and grew up in a very loving home with two amazing parents.  School wasn't too interesting so right after highschool I joined the Marines to find more excitement out of life.  While the Marine Corps provided some very unique thrills it also provided some very unique challenges.  However, getting out and finding an identiy afterwards is proving to be the most ardous challenge of all.
